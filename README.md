# Posture-Detector

### Goal: To create an application that runs entirely on web browser and detects postures of human beings.

### Motivation:
https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5

### Project Brief:
I have used a basic html template and a java script file for creating the entire application.
I have used javascript machine learning libraries like p5.js, ml5.js, Posenet and hosted the entire application on Github.

### Glimpse of the app:

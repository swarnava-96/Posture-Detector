# Posture-Detector

### Goal: To create an application that runs entirely on web browser and detects postures of human beings.

### Motivation:

### Project Brief:
I have used a basic html template and a java script file for creating the entire application.
I have used javascript machine learning libraries like p5.js and ml5.js and hosted the entire application on Github.
